# Portfolio project
This is my personal portfolio

This is my second week project at the IO academy. I put into practise the theory we went over during week one. I opted to go for a simplistic app that would allow me to use and practise the key points we went over. 

The app is able to function and be reactive to both mobile and desktop users.
